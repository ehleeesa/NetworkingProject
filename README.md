# Networking Project – Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrating foundational networking concepts, device configuration, and network design.
The main file in this project is:

NetworkingProject.pkt


This project can be opened using Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x or later.

### Project goals:

- Build a functional multi-device network topology

- Configure routers, switches, and end devices

- Implement IP addressing and connectivity

- Practice common networking tasks such as VLANs, routing, and verification commands

### Topology summary:

## This Packet Tracer project includes:

- Routers: Basic routing configuration

- Switches: Layer 2 switching, VLANs

- End devices: PCs, laptops, servers

- Connections: Copper and fiber cabling appropriately used

If your project includes additional components (DHCP, OSPF, inter-VLAN routing, etc.), I can insert them here — just tell me.


### Features Implemented

## Typical features this project demonstrates:

- VLAN configuration

- Router interface configuration

- Inter-VLAN routing

- Static or dynamic routing

- DHCP setup

- Basic security (passwords, banners, etc.)

- Connectivity testing with ping, traceroute

### How to use:

- Install Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x

- Open the project file:

- File → Open → NetworkingProject.pkt


Explore the topology or view device configurations.
Modify, test, or expand the network as needed.

### Testing & Verification

## Common verification commands:

show ip interface brief
show vlan brief
show running-config
ping <destination>
traceroute <destination>
